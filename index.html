<h1>About The Person</h1>
<img src = "/home/fariz/face_trans.png" width = "264" height = "294" alt="Profile Picture">
<p>The name is Fariz Adnan Wicaksono, briefly referred to as 'Fariz'. Born 25 years ago in Canberra, Australia, he is currently a final year student in Universitas Gadjah Mada, at the Computer Science and Electronics Departement. His main specialties and interests are high-performance computing, scientific computation, parallel programming, and scientific instrumentation.</p>
<p>In the spare time he enjoys many activities such as, reading books, listening to music (french romantic is his all time fave) and physical exercises.</p>
<p>He is not a big fan of the modern hustle culture, and deeply believe in the concept of greater purpose (basically an anti-nihilist). There are a couple of practical philosophy he personally holds onto: 
<dl>
<dt>Things that has been around for longer will also likely be around longer.</dt>
<dd>The law of of the survival of the fittest apply. The longer a system has been around, the more they are proven to have stood the test of time; the more likely they are to do so in the future. This might explain why "outdated technologies" like C remains popular while the future also holds true: the newer the technology is, the more likely they are resembling a trend impulse.</dd>
<dt>Failing to prepare is preparing to fail.</dt>
<dd>No further explanation needed. Better having something unused than having it unprepared.</dd>
